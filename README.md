# office-light-switch

I wanted to turn on and off my office light with just my keyboard.

Use autohotkey to map `ctrl + l` and `ctrl + ;` to office light on and off, respectively

Webhooks to eWeLink control via IFTTT are triggered in batch scripts (windows) when the autohotkey mappings are pressed.
